ChaML - a type-checker that uses constraints and a kernel language
==================================================================

Requires OCaml 3.12 or higher, as well as ocamlbuild.

Run make to build the executable.
Run make tests to launch the test suite.
Run make clean to clean.

As of 2010-03-31, the OCaml parser has been modified to work with Menhir.
However, only part of the locations have meaningful contents. There is still
some work needed to convert the whole parser to $startpos and $endpos.

The following folders are imports from the OCaml source tree.
- driver
- parsing
- utils
